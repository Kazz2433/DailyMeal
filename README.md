### The Motivation for Development

Having a regulated and healthy diet is the first step towards better health and increased productivity, but many people have no idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow many meals to have in a day or what to wait for, so together with a healthy food API we have produced a generator for planning meals main meals of the day and 100% healthy.

**This application is also part of our personal project, which consists of making one application per week.**

This is the week 1 project. If you want to know more about our project here is a link for you to follow:
